<title> You wake up, nothing again
Old and broken and tired
Go to sleep all alone
Wake up all alone
If I said that I cared I'd be lying </title>

<p><font face = "Friz Quadrata" size = "3">Oh my god, I fear I can't be saved.
These idle hands have slowly dug my grave.
Every day is the same.
Feels like I'm disintegrating.
Back into the dust from which I came.
So I got in my car and I drove and I drove.
All night 'til I couldn't stay awake.
Went through Louisiana.
As far as I went wouldn't ever be quite far enough away.
And I never wanna feel like I'm dying.
'Cause the time that you waste won't come back.
So I took a part of me that I hated.
And I tried to leave it in the past.
You wake up, nothing again.
Old and broken and tired.
Go to sleep all alone.
Wake up all alone.
If I said that I cared I'd be lying.
You wake up, nothing again.
Old and broken and tired.
Go to sleep all alone.
Wake up all alone.
If I said that I cared I'd be lying.
You wake up.
You're nothing.
You're tired.
You're struggling.
I just wanna try to be a better man before I fall apart.
You wake up.
You're nothing.
You're tired.
You're struggling.
Trouble always finds me even when I'm hidden way down in the dust.
You wake up.
You're nothing.
You're tired.
You're struggling.
They say that we came from dust and to dust we will all return.
You wake up.
You're nothing.
You're tired.
You're struggling.
My days are numbered fewer than the lessons that I've never learned.
I'm waiting on all of my demons.
To come and take me home.
